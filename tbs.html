                <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                        <p>Do you know what to do if your screen goes blank? What if you can't seem to close an application, or can't hear any sound from your speakers? Whenever you have a problem with your computer, <strong>don't panic!</strong> There are many <strong>basic troubleshooting techniques</strong> you can use to fix issues like this. In this lesson, we'll show you some simple things to try when troubleshooting, as well as how to solve common problems you may encounter.</p>
                        <h4>General tips to keep in mind</h4>
                        <p>There are many different things that could cause a problem with your computer. No matter what's causing the issue, troubleshooting will always be a process of <strong>trial and error</strong>â€”in some cases, you may need to use several different approaches before you can find a solution; other problems may be easy to fix. We recommend starting by using the following tips.</p>
                        <ul><li><strong>Write down your steps</strong>: Once you start troubleshooting, you may want to <strong>write down </strong>each step you take. This way, you'll be able to remember exactly what you've done and can avoid repeating the same mistakes. If you end up asking other people for help, it will be much easier if they know exactly what you've tried already.</li><li><strong>Take notes about error messages</strong>: If your computer gives you an <strong>error message</strong>, be sure to write down as much information as possible. You may be able to use this information later to find out if other people are having the same error.</li><li><strong>Always check the cables</strong>: If you're having trouble with a specific piece of computer <strong>hardware</strong>, such as your monitor or keyboard, an easy first step is to check all related cables to make sure they're properly connected. <div><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073327dd48174331f516f_01_17_2014/troubleshooting_cables.jpg" alt="cables" title="cables"></div></li><li><strong>Restart the computer</strong>: When all else fails, <strong>restarting the computer</strong> is a good thing to try. This can solve a lot of basic issues you may experience with your computer.</li></ul>

                  <h3>Using the process of elimination</h3>
                        <p>If you're having an issue with your computer, you may be able to find out what's wrong using <strong>the</strong> <strong>process of elimination</strong>. This means you'll make a list of things that could be causing the problem and then test them out one by one to eliminate them. Once you've identified the source of your computer issue, it will be easier to find a solution.</p>
                        <h4>Scenario:</h4>
                        <p>Let's say you're trying to print out invitations for a birthday party, but the printer won't print. You have some ideas about what could be causing this, so you go through them one by one to see if you can <strong>eliminate</strong> any possible causes.</p>
                        <p>First, you check the  printer to see that it's turned on and plugged in to the <strong>surge protector</strong>. It is, so that's not the issue. Next, you check to make sure the printer's <strong>ink cartridge</strong> still has ink and that there is paper loaded in the <strong>paper tray</strong>. Things look good in both cases, so you know the issue has nothing to do with ink or paper.</p>
                        <p>Now you want to make sure the printer and computer are <strong>communicating correctly</strong>. If you recently downloaded an<strong> update to your operating system</strong>, it might interfere with the printer. But you know there haven't been any recent updates and the printer was working yesterday, so you'll have to look elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>You check the printer's <strong>USB cord</strong> and find that it's not plugged in. You must have unplugged it accidentally when you plugged something else into the computer earlier. Once you plug in the USB cord, the printer starts working again. It looks like this printer issue is solved!</p>
                        <p>This is just one example of an issue you might encounter while using a computer. In the rest of this lesson, we'll talk about other common computer problems and some ways to solve them.</p>

                  <br> <br> <br>                  
                  <h3>Simple solutions to common problems</h3>
                        <p>Most of the time, problems can be fixed using simple troubleshooting techniques, like <strong>closing</strong> and <strong>reopening</strong> the program. It's important to try these simple solutions before resorting to more extreme measures. If the problem still isn't fixed, you can try other troubleshooting techniques.</p>
                        <h4>Problem: Power button will not start computer</h4>
                        <ul><li><strong>Solution 1</strong>: If your computer <strong>does not start</strong>, begin by checking the power cord to confirm that it is plugged securely into the back of the computer case and the power outlet.</li><li><strong>Solution 2</strong>: If it is plugged into an outlet, make sure it is a <strong>working outlet</strong>. To check your outlet, you can plug in another <strong>electrical device</strong>, such as a lamp<strong>.</strong></li><li><strong></strong><strong>Solution 3</strong>: If the computer is plugged in to a <strong>surge protector</strong>, verify that it is turned on. You may have to <strong>reset</strong> the surge protector by turning it off and then back on. You can also plug a lamp or other device into the surge protector to verify that it's working correctly. <div><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073327dd48174331f516f_01_17_2014/troubleshooting_surgeprotector.jpg" alt="surge protector" title="surge protector"></div></li><li><strong>Solution 4</strong>: If you are using a <strong>laptop</strong>, the <strong>battery</strong> may not be charged. Plug the <strong>AC adapter</strong> into the wall, then try to turn on the laptop. If it still doesn't start up, you may need to wait a few minutes and try again.</li></ul>
                  <br>
                      <h4>Problem: An application is running slowly</h4>
                            <ul><li><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Close and reopen the application.</li><li><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Update the application.

                  <h3>Solving more difficult problems</h3>
                        <p>If you still haven't found a solution to your problem, you may need to ask someone else for help. As an easy starting point, we'd recommend <strong>searching the Web</strong>. It's  possible that other users have had similar problems, and solutions to these problems are often posted online. Also, if you have a friend or family member who knows a lot about computers, they may be able to help you. <br></p>
                        <div><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073327dd48174331f516f_01_17_2014/troubleshooting_google_search.jpg" style="width: 423px; height: 288.967px;" alt="Google search of Windows 10" title="Google search of Windows 10" width="423" height="288.967"></div>
                        <p>Keep in mind that most computer problems have simple solutions, although it may take some time to find them. For difficult problems, a <strong>more drastic solution</strong> may be required, like reformatting your hard drive or reinstalling your operating system. If you think you might need a solution like this, we recommend <strong>consulting a professional</strong> first. If you're not a computer expert, it's possible that attempting these solutions could make the situation worse.</p> <br><br><br>
